# PythonServer-lifty
A school project to reduce CO2-emissions by providing a platform to parents so they can take other children with them when 
driving their children to school.

Planned is a website, an Android app and a IOS app, also a python server,
which processes data and runs an algorithm on location 
data and the number of vehicles in order to find the optimal routes to the school.
